# Product Context: AI-Enhanced Project & Knowledge Management System

## Why This Project Exists

### Problem Statement
Modern knowledge workers struggle with:
1. **Fragmented Project Management**: Tools that don't connect strategic goals to actionable tasks
2. **Knowledge Loss**: Completed work and learnings are buried in closed tickets and forgotten
3. **Repetitive Work**: Similar projects start from scratch instead of leveraging past experience
4. **Context Switching**: Multiple tools for planning, execution, and knowledge management
5. **AI Integration Gap**: AI tools exist in isolation rather than integrated into workflows

### Target Users
- **Project Managers**: Need structured hierarchy and progress tracking
- **Knowledge Workers**: Require task guidance and knowledge retention
- **Teams**: Want collaborative workflows with AI assistance
- **Consultants**: Need reusable templates and knowledge bases

## How It Should Work

### Core User Experience
1. **Dashboard Entry**: User selects project type (Consultancy, Marketing, Personal Goals)
2. **AI-Guided Setup**: System suggests Epic breakdown based on project type
3. **Iterative Refinement**: User edits suggestions, AI learns preferences
4. **Progress Tracking**: Automated status updates with intelligent recommendations
5. **Knowledge Capture**: Completed work automatically feeds knowledge base

### Key Workflows

#### Project Creation Flow
```
Select Project Type → AI Suggests Epics → User Refines → Generate Stories → Create Tasks → Begin Execution
```

#### Daily Work Flow
```
Check To-Do → AI Recommends Next Actions → Complete Tasks → Update Progress → Capture Learnings
```

#### Knowledge Reuse Flow
```
New Project → AI Searches Past Work → Suggests Templates → User Customizes → Rapid Setup
```

### AI Assistance Patterns
- **Proactive Suggestions**: "Based on similar projects, consider adding..."
- **Clarifying Questions**: "What does success look like for this Epic?"
- **Progress Insights**: "This task type typically takes 2-3 days"
- **Knowledge Retrieval**: "You solved a similar problem in Project X"
