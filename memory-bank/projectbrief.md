# Project Brief: AI-Enhanced Project & Knowledge Management System

## Project Overview
The AI-Enhanced Project & Knowledge Management System is a comprehensive, intelligent platform designed to manage projects, generate tasks, and retain reusable knowledge using AI assistance.

## Core Objectives
1. **Structured Project Management**: Implement a hierarchical system (Epic > Story > Task) with proper relationships and dependencies
2. **AI-Powered Assistance**: Integrate Claude/OpenAI for task generation, progress monitoring, and intelligent recommendations
3. **Knowledge Retention**: Build a searchable knowledge base that learns from completed work and provides reusable insights
4. **Template Engine**: Create reusable, AI-readable templates for all project entities
5. **Multi-Modal Interface**: Support dashboard, Kanban, timeline, and other views for different work styles

## Technical Requirements
- **Frontend**: React 18+ with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, modern UI/UX
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express, RESTful APIs, enterprise-grade security
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for primary data, Redis for caching
- **AI Integration**: Claude (primary), OpenAI (fallback) with structured prompting
- **Architecture**: Microservices, cloud-native, scalable design

## Success Criteria
1. Complete project hierarchy management with full CRUD operations
2. AI agents providing contextual assistance throughout workflows
3. Knowledge base with semantic search and auto-tagging
4. Template system supporting rapid project initialization
5. Production-ready system with comprehensive testing

## Quality Standards
- Enterprise-grade development practices
- Comprehensive testing coverage
- TypeScript strict mode
- Proper error handling and logging
- Security-first approach
- Performance optimization

## Timeline
