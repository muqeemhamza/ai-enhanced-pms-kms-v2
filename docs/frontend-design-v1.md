# 🎨 Frontend Design Specification v1.0

## 📋 Overview

This document defines the first iteration of the AI-Enhanced Project & Knowledge Management System frontend interface design. It establishes the user experience patterns, visual hierarchy, and interaction flows for the entire application.

## 🏗️ Design Principles

### **Visual Hierarchy**
- **Purple** (🟣) for Epics - Strategic level
- **Blue** (🔵) for Stories - Functional level  
- **Green** (🟢) for Tasks - Action level
- **Orange** (🟠) for Knowledge Base entries

### **AI Integration Philosophy**
- Subtle suggestion bubbles with clear actions
- Context-aware recommendations
- Non-intrusive but always accessible
- Clear indication when AI is "thinking" or has suggestions

### **Information Architecture**
- Clean, uncluttered layouts
- Collapsible sections for detailed information
- Quick-scan cards for overview
- Progressive disclosure of complexity

### **Responsive Design**
- Mobile-first approach
- Touch-friendly interface elements
- Adaptive layouts for different screen sizes
- Consistent navigation patterns
