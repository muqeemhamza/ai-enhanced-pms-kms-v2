## Detailed Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Consulting Project Setup

**Primary Actor:** Sarah (Project Manager)  
**Goal:** Set up a new client consulting engagement
**Preconditions:** User is authenticated and has project creation permissions

**Main Success Scenario:**
1. Sarah logs into the system and navigates to "New Project"
2. She selects "Consultancy" as the project type
3. System prompts for client information and engagement details
4. AI analyzes input and suggests initial Epics:
   - Discovery & Assessment
   - Current State Analysis  
   - Solution Design
   - Implementation Planning
   - Delivery & Handoff
5. Sarah reviews suggestions, edits "Solution Design" to "Technical Architecture"
6. System creates project with 5 Epics and generates initial Stories for each
7. Sarah assigns team members to different Epics
8. Project is ready for team collaboration within 5 minutes

**Alternative Flows:**
- AI suggestions are completely rejected → User creates custom Epic structure
- No team members available → Project created as individual work
- Client requirements change → Easy Epic modification and regeneration

### Use Case 2: AI-Assisted Development Task

**Primary Actor:** Alex (Developer)  
**Goal:** Complete a complex development task with AI assistance
**Preconditions:** Task is assigned and development environment is ready

**Main Success Scenario:**
1. Alex opens assigned Task: "Implement user authentication middleware"
2. AI analyzes Task context and suggests:
   - Relevant code patterns from knowledge base
   - Security best practices
   - Testing approaches
   - Similar past implementations
3. Alex reviews suggestions and selects JWT-based approach
4. AI provides code snippets and configuration examples
5. Alex implements solution with AI-suggested modifications
6. System automatically captures implementation details for knowledge base
7. Task is marked complete with lessons learned documented

**Alternative Flows:**
- AI suggestions are not relevant → Alex provides feedback for system learning
- Implementation faces blockers → AI suggests troubleshooting approaches
- Task scope expands → AI helps break down into subtasks

### Use Case 3: Knowledge Reuse for New Project

**Primary Actor:** Jordan (Consultant)  
**Goal:** Leverage past project knowledge for new similar engagement
**Preconditions:** System has captured knowledge from previous projects

**Main Success Scenario:**
1. Jordan creates new project: "E-commerce Platform Optimization"
2. AI searches knowledge base and finds 3 similar past projects
3. System suggests:
   - Reusable Epic templates from "E-commerce Analytics Implementation"
   - Task patterns from "Platform Performance Optimization"
   - Best practices from "Customer Journey Analysis"
4. Jordan selects relevant templates and customizes for current client
5. AI adapts templates to new context and requirements
6. Project is initialized with 70% structure from past work
7. Jordan focuses on client-specific requirements rather than basic setup

**Alternative Flows:**
- No similar past projects → Standard template with AI-generated structure
- Multiple relevant projects → AI merges best practices from multiple sources
- Client has unique requirements → AI adapts templates while preserving proven patterns
