# 📌 AI‑Enhanced Project & Knowledge Management System

A structured, intelligent system to manage projects, generate tasks, and retain reusable knowledge using AI assistance.

---

## 🔧 Core Components

### 1. **Dashboard**
- **Purpose**: Central hub to select and manage project types.
- **Features**:
  - Project/Business Type Selector:
    - Examples: `Stocks`, `Consultancy`, `Personal Goals`, `Marketing`, `Video Generation`
  - Live project summary widgets (active epics, overdue tasks, next AI recommendations).
  - AI-generated overviews: task momentum, blockers, and priority shifts.

---

### 2. **Project Hierarchy**
#### Structure:
- **Epic**: Strategic, high-level goals.
- **Story**: Functional requirement or sub-goal under an Epic.
- **Task**: Specific, actionable step derived from a Story.
- **Relationships**:
  - Parent-Child links: `Epic > Story > Task`
  - Cross-dependencies: “Task A must be done before Task B”

#### Pages:
- Each entity (Epic, Story, Task) has its own dedicated page with metadata and progress tracking.

---

### 3. **AI Assistance**
- Auto-suggest Stories and Tasks when a new Epic is created.
- Auto-fill checklists, substeps, and estimated timelines.
- Clarify vague inputs by asking user questions.
- Monitor progress and update status dynamically.
- Recommend “Next Best Actions” in To‑Do Lists.

---

### 4. **Knowledge Base (Agent Mind)**
- **Purpose**: Store valuable learnings, completed work, how-to guides, troubleshooting steps.
- **Features**:
  - Entries:
    - Completed Epics/Stories/Tasks
    - Technical/how-to documentation (e.g. “Claude–Cursor Integration”)
  - Smart Search:
    - Semantic search and tag-based filtering
  - AI Recall:
    - Past entries surfaced automatically when related projects are created
  - Tagging:
    - Auto-tagging by domain, tool, outcome
  - Maintenance:
    - Auto-flagging of stale or outdated entries

---

### 5. **Progress Tracking & To‑Do**
- **Views**:
  - Kanban, Gantt, Timeline
- **To-Do Lists**:
  - AI-generated based on dependencies, deadlines, and project velocity
  - Prioritized by urgency, impact, and risk

---

## 📋 Template Engine

### General Principles
- Templates are AI-readable and editable by users.
- Markdown or block-structured format.
- AI assists with formatting and missing fields.
- Templates are reusable and expandable over time.

  - Freshness badge and links to related entries

---

## 🔄 Automations & Integrations

- **Automation Rules**:
  - Auto-linking dependent tasks
  - Timeline forecasting using KB
  - Suggested assignees based on past work
  - Alert system for delays or blockers

- **Integrations**:
  - GitHub, Jira, Slack, Trello, Google Calendar
  - Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor
  - Zapier/webhooks for automation

---

## 📊 Reporting & Insights

- **Widgets**:
  - Epic Progress %
  - Story Completion vs Deadline
  - Blocked Task Monitor
- **AI Reports**:
  - Predict risks based on patterns
  - Post-Epic retrospectives with KB writebacks
  - Reuse analytics (% reused vs new work)

---

## 🤖 Sample AI Prompts

```
📌 Epic Creation Prompt:
“You’ve started a new Epic. Based on the objective, I’ll now break this down into Stories.
Please clarify: What does success look like? Who are the stakeholders? When is the deadline?”

🧩 Story Prompt:
“This Story aligns with [Epic X]. Based on context, here are 3 recommended tasks.
Do you want to edit, add, or accept them?”

✅ Task Prompt:
“What are the expected steps? Who is the owner? Want to see similar past tasks from the KB?”

📚 KB Retrieval Prompt:
“I found 2 similar entries from your Knowledge Base:
- ‘Claude + Cursor Integration’
- ‘Setting up GitHub MCP’
Would you like to view and reuse these?”
```

## 🖼️ UI/UX Design Guidelines

- **Visual Aesthetic**: Clean, modern (inspired by Notion + Linear)
- **Component Blocks**: Collapsible content for Epics, Stories, Tasks
- **Color Cues**: Status (Green = Done, Yellow = In Progress), Priority (High/Medium/Low)
- **Dark/Light Toggle**: Universal compatibility
- **AI Hints**: Inline suggestion bubbles with “Apply” or “Refine” options
- **Mobile Responsive**: Usable on phones, tablets, and desktop

## 🔁 Example Flow

1. User selects `Consultancy > New Project` from Dashboard.
2. Enters Epic: “Audit for Client XYZ”.
3. AI suggests:
   - “Data Collection”
   - “Process Mapping”
   - “Client Reporting”
4. User edits and confirms; Stories created.
5. Tasks are generated under each Story.
6. AI tracks progress and recommends daily To-Dos.
7. All completed items go into the Knowledge Base.
8. Future audit projects reuse previous setups with 1-click.
